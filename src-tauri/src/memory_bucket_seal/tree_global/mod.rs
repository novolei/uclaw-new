//! Global Activity Digest tree (Phase 3b — openhuman port).
//!
//! A singleton cross-source recap structure: one tree per workspace, built
//! end-of-day from the source trees' current material so a question like
//! "what did I do in the last 7 days?" resolves with one summary hop.
//! Unlike source trees (whose L0 holds raw chunk leaves), the global tree's
//! L0 already holds synthesised **daily** summaries — each a fold of the
//! day's activity across every active source tree.
//!
//! Level conventions (time-axis aligned, not token-driven):
//!   - L0 = one node per **day** (emitted by [`digest::end_of_day_digest`])
//!   - L1 = one node per **week** (~7 daily leaves)
//!   - L2 = one node per **month** (~4 weekly nodes)
//!   - L3 = one node per **year** (~12 monthly nodes)
//!
//! Reuses Phase 3a storage (`mem_tree_trees`/`mem_tree_summaries`/
//! `mem_tree_buffers` with `kind='global'`) and the `Summariser`/`Embedder`
//! traits. The count-based seal trigger replaces the source tree's
//! token-budget gate.
